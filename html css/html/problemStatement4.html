        <h1>Stratovocanos</h1>
        <div>A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata)
            of hardened <a href="#"> lava</a> and <a href="#"> tephra</a>. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are
            characterized by a steep
            profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although
            some have collapsed summit craters called calderas. </div><br>

        <div style="margin-right: 10px;">Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called composite volcanoes because of their
            composite stratified structure,
            built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials. They are among the most common types of
            volcanoes, in contrast to the less common shield <a href="#"> volcanoes</a>.[4] Two famous examples of
            stratovolcanoes are
            Krakatoa in Indonesia, known for its <a href="#"> catastrophic eruption</a> in 1883, and Vesuvius in Italy,
            whose
            <a href="#">catastrophic eruption</a> in AD 79 buried the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Both
            eruptions claimed
            thousands of lives. In modern times, Mount St. Helens in Washington State, US, and Mount Pinatubo in the
            Philippines have erupted catastrophically, but with fewer deaths

        <div style="margin-left: 10px ;">This is a pit that has been dug into the ground at <a href="#"> Cotopaxi</a>, a
            big strato volcano near
            Quito, the capital
            city of Ecuador. The pit is about 2 meters deep and in it you can clearly see a number of ash layers
            exposed. It is also easy to see that the layers are different - some are coarse and others are fine, some
            are dark-colored and others are light-colored.</div>
        <div style="margin-left: 10px ;">The lava at strato <a href="#"> volcanoes</a> occasionally forms 'a'a, but more
            commonly it barely flows at
            all, preferring
            to pile up in the vent to form volcanic domes. Some strato volcanoes are just a collection of domes piled up
            on each other. Strato volcanoes are commonly found along subduction-related volcanic arcs, and the magma
            supply rates to strato volcanoes are lower. This is the cause of the cooler and differentiated magma
            compositions and the reason for the usually long repose periods between eruptions. Examples of strato
            volcanoes include <a href="#">Mt. St. Helens</a>, <a href="#"> Mt. Rainier</a>,<a href="#"> Pinatubo</a>,
            <a>Mt. Fuji</a>, Merapi, Galeras, Cotopaxi, and super
            plenty others.
